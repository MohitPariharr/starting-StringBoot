Spring Boot Starter Dependencies - My Week 1 of Learning Spring Boot
"I recently completed a practice task focused on Spring Boot Starter Dependencies. The task involved setting up a Spring Boot project and exploring how starter dependencies streamline development by handling required libraries automatically.

üîë Key Takeaways:
‚úÖ Understanding Spring Boot Starters:
Spring Boot provides pre-configured dependency sets like spring-boot-starter-web for web applications and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for database operations. These help avoid version conflicts and simplify project setup.

‚úÖ Auto-Configuration Magic:
Spring Boot auto-configures beans based on the dependencies present in the classpath, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing productivity.

üöÄ Challenges & Solutions:
üîπ Dependency Version Conflicts:
Initially faced some issues with conflicting dependencies, but specifying explicit versions in pom.xml resolved the problem.

üîπ Customizing Default Behavior:
By modifying application.properties, I was able to override default configurations like the embedded Tomcat port and database connection settings.

üåç Practical Application:
Understanding starter dependencies is essential for building scalable Spring Boot applications. It ensures that developers can focus on business logic instead of dependency management.

üéØEager vs. Lazy Loading:
While working with Spring Data JPA, I explored how Eager loading fetches related entities immediately, whereas Lazy loading fetches them only when needed, improving performance in large applications.

üéØ What's Next?
(Looking forward to building REST APIs with Spring Boot and integrating database operations using Spring Data JPA!)

Logging & Hibernate in Spring Boot - My Week 2 of Learning Spring Boot

I recently completed a practice task focused on Logging in Spring Boot and JPA with Hibernate. The task involved configuring Spring Boot logging, understanding Hibernate's role in JPA, and implementing efficient data persistence using these technologies.

Key Takeaways
Understanding Logging in Spring Boot
Spring Boot uses SLF4J with Logback as the default logging framework. By configuring application.properties or logback.xml, we can control log levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR.

JPA & Hibernate in Spring Boot
Spring Boot integrates JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate to manage relational databases easily. The spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency simplifies CRUD operations with minimal configurations.

Challenges and Solutions
Handling SQL Queries in Logs
By setting logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG, I was able to track executed queries, which helped optimize database interactions.

Lazy vs. Eager Loading
Faced performance issues with Eager fetching but optimized queries by switching to Lazy loading and using @Transactional when necessary.

Practical Application
Efficient logging ensures better debugging, and understanding JPA with Hibernate helps in designing scalable, high-performance database applications.

What‚Äôs Next
(Looking forward to exploring Spring Boot REST APIs and diving deeper into advanced Hibernate features like caching and criteria queries.)

Paging & Sorting in Spring Boot (Pageable & Sort) - My Week 3 of Learning Spring Boot

I recently completed a practice task focused on Paging & Sorting in Spring Boot using Pageable and Sort. The task involved implementing efficient data retrieval methods to handle large datasets in a Spring Boot application.

Key Takeaways
Understanding Paging & Sorting
Spring Boot provides built-in support for pagination and sorting using the Pageable and Sort interfaces in Spring Data JPA. This helps optimize database queries and improve application performance.

Using Pageable for Pagination:
By implementing the Pageable interface, I was able to fetch a subset of data, reducing the load on the database. The PageRequest.of(page, size) method allows fetching data page by page, improving efficiency in large applications.

Sorting Data with Sort:
The Sort class in Spring Boot enables dynamic sorting of records based on different fields. Using Sort.by("fieldName").ascending() and Sort.by("fieldName").descending(), I implemented flexible sorting mechanisms.

Challenges and Solutions:
Handling Large Datasets Efficiently
Initially faced performance issues when retrieving all records at once. Implementing pagination with Pageable helped optimize database queries and improve response times.

Combining Pagination and Sorting
Learned how to apply both pagination and sorting together using Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("field").descending()), allowing users to retrieve data in a structured manner.

Practical Application
Paging and sorting are essential for building scalable and responsive applications. By limiting and ordering data efficiently, I was able to enhance the user experience and database performance in my Spring Boot project.

What‚Äôs Next
(Looking forward to exploring Spring Boot REST APIs with Pagination & Sorting and integrating it into a real-world application.)

One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-One Mapping in Spring Boot - My Week 4 of Learning Spring Boot
I recently completed a practice task focused on entity relationships in Spring Boot, specifically One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-One mappings, along with implementing DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for efficient data transfer. The task involved setting up entity relationships using Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate to better structure data models.

Key Takeaways
Understanding One-to-One Mapping
One-to-One mapping is used when one entity is directly related to another. I implemented this using the @OneToOne annotation along with @JoinColumn to define the foreign key relationship.

Understanding One-to-Many and Many-to-One Mapping
One-to-Many and Many-to-One mappings allow an entity to be related to multiple entities. Using @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations, I structured my database to handle parent-child relationships efficiently.

Implementing DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
DTOs help in transferring only the required data to the client, improving performance and security. Instead of exposing full entity objects, I used DTOs to format API responses efficiently.

Challenges and Solutions
Handling Lazy Initialization Issues
Faced issues when fetching related entities due to lazy loading. Resolved it by using DTOs and writing custom JPQL queries with JOIN FETCH to fetch related data only when needed.

Managing Bidirectional Relationships
Initially encountered problems with infinite recursion when using bidirectional relationships. Used @JsonIgnore and @JsonManagedReference to break cyclic dependencies in JSON responses.

Practical Application
Understanding entity relationships and DTOs is essential for designing scalable databases and optimizing API responses. These concepts ensure structured data handling in real-world applications, such as e-commerce platforms and content management systems.

What‚Äôs Next
Looking forward to implementing Many-to-Many relationships and optimizing database queries using criteria queries and caching.
